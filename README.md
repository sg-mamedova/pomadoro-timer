# pomadoro-timer
Human mind can only concentrate for about 25 minutes. The pomadoro method breaks work down into 25-minute chunks to optimize productivity. After a pomadoro time, you should take a break for 5 minutes.

The idea of the application is based on the book "Technique of Tomato" - the time management technique proposed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
